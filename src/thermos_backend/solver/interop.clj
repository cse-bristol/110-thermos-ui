  "This is a translation layer between the UI representation of a problem, and the network model format.

  The input to the network model is described in thermos.opt.net.specs.

  The main distinctions made here are:

  - The network model doesn't care about NPV or financing; it just
    trades off interchangeable costs. NPV and loans are applied here
    to produce single figures for the network model.

    The user interface does care about NPV and financing, so the NPV
    figures are recomputed on the way out for display purposes and stuck
    back onto the UI representation.

  - A certain amount of graph simplification is done in here, to
    shrink the problem before the network model sees it

  - Pipe costs are understood in the UI to be taken from a table.
    Power / diameter relationship is understood in terms of the medium

    The network model doesn't know this, it knows fixed cost and cost/kw

    This translation layer approximates pipe costs down to fixed + variable.
    Then it rounds up the decisions that have been made to the next pipe in the table.

  - In the UI, individual / alternative systems can have a 'hot water tank'
    which 'reduces the peak' for the individual system. This is not expressed in the
    network model, but is applied in here by transforming the /costs/ which the
    model optimises on.
